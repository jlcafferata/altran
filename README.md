# altran
Responsive application made with Angular 1.6, which interacts with local data or with data from a remote URL.
The project has all the necessary resources packaged for its operation, including the data that is accessed (data.json).
To execute it you only have to clone the project in the structure of some web page server (xampp or lampp for example) and you're done.
The purpose of the development is very simple: interact with the data of the json and allow filters by name / surname, profession and restrict the view to a certain number of records.
Additional resources used:
- Underscore
- Bootstrap
