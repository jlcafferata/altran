Altran

-Responsive application made with Angular 1.6, which interacts with local data or with data from a remote URL.
-The project has all the necessary resources packaged for its operation, including the data that is accessed (data.json).
-To execute it you only have to clone the project in the structure of some web page server (xampp or lampp for example) and you're done.
-The purpose of the development is very simple: interact with the data of the json and allow filters by name / surname, profession and restrict the view to a certain number of records.
-Additional resources used:
-- Underscore (to manipulate json data)
-- Bootstrap (to improve the visual disposition and responsive disposition)
-- Slow loading (for progressive treatment of image loading)
-- Impressive font (for iconography)
-- Font_face_amaranth (for the main source of the project)
